# groups

In this project we explore how we can functionally represent groups and build cryptographic primitives with those representations.
The end goal is to create a small, modular library to do group theoretical computations functionally, and use that library for cryptography.

Additionally, it would be nice to create some small software application (like an IO chat app or something) with these functional implementations.
That way we would be able to stress test these functions and keep everything as practical as possible.
